break things on accident, fix things on purpose.

### whoami  
building stuff i actually use.  
been around the web space for a little bit, now deep in the rabbit hole of self-hosting, automation, and open systems.  
this whole thing is basically just a learning journey. i like building tools that people actually *use*.

### what i’m into  
🧠 **self-hosting** – docker, tailscale, proxmox, all that good stuff  
💻 **development** – python, javascript, java, react, next, astro, node, typescript, appwrite  
🌲 **life** – old jeeps, good food, mountains, and probably breaking something that was working fine yesterday
